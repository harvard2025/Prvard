## 📚 Description

**Prvard** is a full-featured educational platform that manages your courses and connects students in a university-like environment.

Prvard is inspired by real university systems and design — it lets you create your own **virtual university**, complete with a theme that mimics well-known universities such as **Harvard**, **Oxford**, or **Yale**.

## ✨ How It Works

- **Sign Up & Join or Create a University**
  - Create an account.
  - Choose whether to create your own university or join an existing one using its unique ID.
  - When you create a university, you choose its theme (Harvard, Oxford, Yale).
  - Invite friends to your university with a link — anyone can join.

- **Custom University Email**
  - Every user automatically gets an email address that matches the university theme, e.g., `@harvard.edu`.

- **Full Email System**
  - Send, receive, and manage emails within the platform.
  - Inbox, outbox, compose messages.
  - See if your message was read by the receiver — all styled with the Harvard-like theme.

- **Members Directory**
  - Every user can see all members in their university.
  - Each member has a detailed profile: photo, name, email, classes, points, and more.
  - You can search for people, email them directly, and make friends.

- **Points System**
  - Each member earns **5 points** every day they study any class.
  - Points encourage healthy competition and show how active each student is.
  - You can view everyone’s points and learning progress.

- **Admin Controls**
  - University admins can:
    - Delete the entire university.
    - Remove any member from the university.

## 🎓 Classes & Lessons

- **Create & Manage Courses**
  - Anyone can create a class — just set a name and choose a lesson type (weeks, lectures, lessons, etc.).
  - Students can enroll in any available class, like **CS50x** or **CS50W**.

- **Add & Edit Lessons**
  - Add lessons to your class — each lesson is a simple Markdown page.
  - Lessons can include lecture instructions, videos, external links, and more.
  - Edit or delete lessons anytime.

- **Class Profiles**
  - View class members, see other classes they take, check their points, and enroll in the same classes.

---

## 💬 Class Chat & Community

- Each class has its own private chat room.
- Members can ask questions, discuss topics, and build a strong learning community together.

---

## 💻 Code & Collaboration

- Each class can include:
  - A **GitHub link** for collaboration.
  - A **Codespace** link (e.g., cs50.dev) for live coding.
